# 🚀 **Multi-Step Progress Bar using Bootstrap** 🟢🔵

In this project, we will create a **multi-step progress bar** using **Bootstrap** and **jQuery** for DOM manipulation. Progress bars are commonly used in web applications to visualize the progress of a task. This can be seen in popular websites like YouTube, GitHub, etc., where they display how much of the page is loaded or the progress of an ongoing task such as uploading or downloading content.

The **multi-step progress bar** is a type of progress bar that visualizes work progress in distinct steps, allowing users to see which step they are currently on and how many steps are remaining.

## 📝 **Prerequisites**:

To follow along with this project, you should have a basic understanding of:

- **HTML** 📄
- **CSS** 🎨
- **JavaScript** 💻
- **Bootstrap** 🖌️
- **jQuery** 🔄 (for DOM manipulation)

You will also need:

- A text editor (e.g., VSCode) ✍️
- A web browser to run the code 🌐

## 🚀 **Approach**:

### 1. **HTML Structure**:
We will define the basic structure of the progress bar using **Bootstrap** classes. The progress bar will consist of multiple steps, each represented by a milestone within the progress bar.

### 2. **Styling with Bootstrap**:
We will apply **Bootstrap's** progress bar and step styles to visually indicate each step. Bootstrap's **progress** and **progress-bar** classes will be used to handle the progress bar's overall design, while **step indicators** will show the current step.

### 3. **jQuery for DOM Manipulation**:
We will use **jQuery** to handle the logic for updating the progress bar as the user progresses through each step. This includes incrementing or decrementing the progress, highlighting the active step, and changing the progress bar width.

### 4. **Dynamic Steps**:
As the user interacts with the progress bar, we will dynamically update the visual representation of each step based on the user’s actions.

## 🌟 **Features**:

- **Multi-Step Progress**: A progress bar with multiple steps, displaying the current progress in terms of steps.
  
- **Real-Time Progress Update**: As the user advances, the progress bar updates dynamically, showing the steps they’ve completed.

- **Step-by-Step Visual Feedback**: Each step of the progress is visually marked, allowing the user to easily understand their position.
